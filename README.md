### Natural Language Processing (NLP) on Microsoft Azure Reviews

In this project I leveraged the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modeling technique to analyze the textual data aggregated from a particualr high impact reviews platform, capterra.com to uncover key trends that matter to users of the product.

In NLP, LDA is employed to understand the main topics in large volumes of text, making it easier to summarize or categorize documents based on their content. Given a set of documents, LDA tries to determine the mix of topics that each document represents and the mix of words that define each topic. LDA is a powerful tool in the NLP toolkit for uncovering the hidden thematic structure in a large collection of textual data, which can be impractical to manually analyze for many organizations but bears invaluable insights that inform products innovations, revenue and business growth.

### Exploratory Data Analysis on United States Domestic Flights

In this project, I undertook Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Given the dataset, I formulated and posed specific insight eliciting questions and endeavored to answer these questions from the dataset leveraging the Pandas and Numpy libraries and relevant Visualization toolkits.

### Telecommunications: Customer Retention and Churn Prediction

In this project, I built a classification model to predict a customer’s likelihood to churn for ZQ, a telecommunications company. Applying the data mining processes to the dataset that was provided, I implemented data exploration, preprocessing and dimension reduction. I used a 10-fold cross-validation technique to assess model performance, calculate performance metrics and determine among two models (Logistic Regression and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) which was the most effective model to deploy. On the basis of model performance, I proceed to deploy the Logistic Regression model for the churn classification problem. And conclude with technical and managerial insights for decision makers.

### Bull and Bear Markets:Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects.

In this research, I investigated the Asymmetric Volatility Spillover Effects within and across six major International stock markets Indexes namely United States (S&P 500), Canada (TSX 60), France (CAC 40), Germany (DAX 40), Italy (MIB 30) & Japan (NIKKEI 225). Finding reveal that volatility spillovers are asymmetric, with the largest impact being auto-influence. Canada has the least impact on other countries, while Japan and the US experience the least cross-influence volatility from abroad. Italy is most impacted by external volatility changes. In order to realistically and accurately predict volatility, investors' expectations are a significant factor. In contrast to Bensaida (2019), the United States maintains dominance with respect to global market influence.
